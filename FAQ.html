    	<h1 style="font-family: 'Quicksand', sans-serif;font-size: 50px; text-align:left"> What do I use for college applications?</h1>
    	<p style="font-family: 'Catamaran', sans-serif;font-size: 25px; text-align:left"> The Common, UC, and Coalition Apps are a few college applications that most students use. The Common Application is used by students seeking undergraduate admission to any of the 693 member colleges and universities in 48 states and the District of Columbia, as well as in Canada, China, and many European countries. The University of California (UC) Application is used by the nine undergraduate UC schools: Berkeley, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, San Diego, Davis, Irvine, Santa Cruz, Riverside, and Merced. The Coalition for Access, Affordability, and Success Application is similar to the Common App, but it allows students to start building a college portfolio online as soon as they enter high school. Additionally, the Coalition App represents more than 90 American higher education institutions.</p>

    	<h1 style="font-family: 'Quicksand', sans-serif;font-size: 50px; text-align:left"> What is the difference between a private and public university?</h1>
    	<p style="font-family: 'Catamaran', sans-serif;font-size: 25px; text-align:left"> There are a few differences between private and public universities. These include funding, size, class size, and demographics. Public universities are funded mostly by state governments while private universities are dependent on private contributions, donations, and student tuition. Public universities typically have more students, degree offerings, and larger class sizes than private universities. Also, public colleges typically have more in-state students, due to in-state incentives, whereas private colleges tend to admit more out-of-state students.</p>

    	<h1 style="font-family: 'Quicksand', sans-serif;font-size: 50px; text-align:left"> What are scholarships?</h1>
    	<p style="font-family: 'Catamaran', sans-serif;font-size: 25px; text-align:left"> Scholarships can be grants or payments made to support a student's education. They are awarded to students who have shown academic success or achievements in other ways. Some scholarships for college are merit-based (meeting or exceeding standards set by the scholarship-giver), while others can recieve scholarships for financial reasons.</p>

    	<h1 style="font-family: 'Quicksand', sans-serif;font-size: 50px; text-align:left"> What is financial aid?</h1>
   	<p style="font-family: 'Catamaran', sans-serif;font-size: 25px; text-align:left"> Financial aid helps students pay for their college expenses including tuition and fees, room and board, books and supplies, and transportation. Some examples of financial aid include grants, scholarships, work study, and loans. You can check out the financial aid office for the school of your choice or check the school's website. This way you can check college and state grant deadlines and submit the form by the earliest date to receive the most aid possible.</p>

    	<h1 style="font-family: 'Quicksand', sans-serif;font-size: 50px; text-align:left"> SAT and ACT?</h1>
    	<p style="font-family: 'Catamaran', sans-serif;font-size: 25px; text-align:left"> The SAT and ACT are two standardized tests used for student admission by universities. Both tests are accepted at all 4-year universities. It is not mandatory to take both tests, which means you can take either the SAT or ACT.</p>     
    	<p style="font-family: 'Catamaran', sans-serif;font-size: 25px; text-align:left"> - SAT is a 3 hour test (3 hours, 50 minutes with essay) that consists of three sections: Reading, Writing & Language, and Math. Some universities require completing the essay section as well. The SAT is scored on a scale of 400-1600.</p>
    	<p style="font-family: 'Catamaran', sans-serif;font-size: 25px; text-align:left"> - ACT is 2 hours, 55 minutes (3 hours, 40 minutes with essay). The test consists of four sections: English, Math, Reading, and Science Reasoning. Similar to the SAT, the optional essay is required by some universities. The ACT is scored on a scale of 1-36.</p>
    	<p style="font-family: 'Catamaran', sans-serif;font-size: 25px; text-align:left"> Most students take the SAT or ACT during their junior year. There are many resources available to students for test prep such as tutoring centers, prep books, online courses, etc. Of course, it is up to the student to personalize their study/test plan to fit their schedule and target scores.</p>
